Garbage Classification with CNN:

This repository contains code for garbage classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The purpose of this project is to classify garbage items as either full or empty based on images.

Dataset:

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of labeled images of garbage bins. Each image is labeled as either "full" or "empty" based on whether the garbage bin image is full or empty. The dataset is organized into two separate folders: one for full garbage images and another for empty garbage images.
